# PROJECT DESCRIPTION


#### Update as of March 17, 2019




Due to upcoming exams in my senior year of high school, I will be putting the development of the Personal-Bot project on hold for a few weeks. Hopefully, I will be able to resume again, this time finally finishing up the core features of the project.







## Introduction





This is a personal project I am going to be making that will be focussing on doing menial browsing tasks and retrieve data from online forums for me. This is a direct inspiration from John Fish's project on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnafish/personal_bot).





## Methodology





I want this project to be a practice for working with modules and packages. For that, I am going to be resorting to using traditional .py style files (modules apparently) and learning how to make packages and access them using class hierarchy system in python. This will allow me to learn a proper project workflow I believe. 





## Technology




I am going to be using Python for this project. Moreover, to conduct the webscraping, I will be using the selenium library instead of the webbrowser library because unlike webbrowser, selenium allows me to fill username and password fields to sign into different websites.

## Tasks






The bot (Jarvis) will do a few tasks for me which are still being decided upon. These tasks may be -: finding any recent followers I have gained on Twitter, listing new notifications on Twitter, finding if I have received any new emails (on multiple emails), finding out things from github, finding if any new blogs have been posted on some I follow, and probably more. First, I need to get started!. 





## Commitment






I am in senior year of high school, still I believe that I can find enough time in one day to spend in programming. For programming is not a task or a burden for me, it is a strong passion I plan to pursue. **Therefore, I will be attempting to make at least 1 commit per day on this project**, on GitHub of course.

###### Note: I will be using PyCharm to develop and deploy this project. This is because I do not need the specific capabilities of Jupyter notebook right now in this project, whereas, the functionalities of PyCahrm with developing in modules is extremely beneficial. 




## Importing modules





I have resorted to using the nomrmal .py python files which can be easily imported into a jupyter notebook for testinf. More about Technologies in the section above.

## Running the project




As of now, this project is not avaiable on pip. Please download the repository in your local computer, then run the following in your terminal / Command Prompt.


```bash
cd Personal-Bot
python main.py
```




###### Note: A gif will follow here soon where I will present a small demo on the functionality of this project.
